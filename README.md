# Paveralicious Additions (DISCONTINUED!)
This is a Minecraft Datapack which adds a few items and a way of crafting them. This is meant to be a little addition to tweak the vanilla survival gameplay.

Resourcepack: [https://github.com/Powerspieler/Paveral-Resourcepack](https://github.com/Powerspieler/Paveral-Resourcepack)

## About
All of the items are meant to be late-game content, therefore the whole story begins by killing a shulker in an endcity.
But some books can also be found in overworld chests before that. They tell different stories in which there are hints to various items. Some items can also be found and they have to be disassembled to learn about their "forming"-ingredients.

### Items
#### Bonk-Stick
Just a knockback stick. But this whole datapack started with this one silly idea.

#### Bedrock Breaker
Like the name is already telling, it breaks bedrock. But it comes with its price.

#### Lightning Rod
A staff shooting a lightning, which provides a protection against phantoms.

#### Golden Crook
A staff which converts any mob (- even players) to a sheep and converting them back upon death. Helpful for transporting some villagers or play a trick with some hostile mobs.

#### Wrench
A small tribute to the Debug stick. Rotate and Modify some blocks.

#### Creeper Defuser
Creepers do not break any blocks around players having it in their inventory or inside an item frame.

#### Lightstaff
Light up dark areas with invisible light sources. Light level can be adjusted.
